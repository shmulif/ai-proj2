The gui folder contains a GUI we made for debugging. (We modified a computer graphics project from last semester)

If you wish to use it simply run the program: run_with_gui.py
Once running pressing "M" advances to the next move while "B" returns to the previous move. The GUI is for a connect4 single game and it does not work with a human player.
